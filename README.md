Okay, this is a collection of scripts primarily focused on web crawling, image processing with AI (Ollama), and sitemap analysis. 
However, here is a `README.md` that describes each script individually and then try to infer a potential overarching project.

**First, let's analyze the scripts and potential redundancy/improvements:**

1.  **`app.py` (Flask App):**
    *   Provides a web UI to upload a CSV of URLs.
    *   For each uploaded CSV, it creates a unique job ID and directory.
    *   It then calls `run_crawler_job_sync` (from `crawler.py`) in a background thread to process the URLs.
    *   **Purpose:** Web frontend for initiating crawling jobs.

2.  **`crawler.py`:**
    *   This seems to be the core image crawling and analysis logic.
    *   It takes a CSV of URLs, crawls each URL for images using Playwright.
    *   Downloads images to a job-specific directory.
    *   Uses Ollama (Llava model) to generate descriptions, categorize content, and moderate images.
    *   Saves all analysis results for a job into `analysis_results.json`.
    *   Includes `run_crawler_job_sync` which is a synchronous wrapper for `run_crawler_job_async`.
    *   **Purpose:** Main image crawling and AI analysis engine.

3.  **`sitemap_processor.py` (or `last_update_rss.py` based on your file naming):**
    *   This script is a FastAPI application with two versions provided (one processing a single URL via query param, the other processing a CSV upload).
    *   It fetches sitemaps (index and regular) from a given URL.
    *   Extracts `<loc>` (URL) and `<lastmod>` (last modification date) from the sitemaps.
    *   Returns results as JSON.
    *   **Purpose:** API for sitemap analysis to get URLs and their last modification dates.

4.  **`playwright_img_crawler.py`:**
    *   This script focuses on scraping the **single most likely logo image** from websites listed in `unique_links_providers.csv`.
    *   It uses Playwright and a scoring heuristic to identify logos.
    *   Saves one logo image per website to a folder named after the domain.
    *   **Purpose:** Specialized logo scraper.

**Sorting Recommendation:**

Given the Flask app (`app.py`) and the `crawler.py` which it uses, these form a central "Image Crawling & Analysis Service."

*   **Core Service:**
    *   `app.py` (Flask frontend)
    *   `crawler.py` (Backend crawling and AI processing engine)
*   **Specialized Tools:**
    *   `sitemap_processor.py` (FastAPI for sitemap analysis - could be a separate microservice or utility)
    *   `playwright_img_crawler.py` (Specific logo scraper - might be a utility script)
*   **Likely Redundant/Superseded (or for specific, isolated testing):**
    *   `img_crawl.py`
    *   `retrieve_img_allsites.py`

    (Unless these have very specific, different configurations or slight behavioral differences you need to keep separate).

Here's a `README.md` structured around the identified components. I'll assume for this README that `crawler.py` is the primary engine used by `app.py`, and the others are utilities or separate services.

# 🖼️ Web Content & Image Processing Suite

This project is a collection of Python scripts designed for web crawling, image extraction, AI-powered image analysis (using Ollama), sitemap processing, and logo scraping. The central piece is a Flask application that allows users to submit URLs via CSV for comprehensive image crawling and analysis.

## 🌟 Core Components

### 1. 🚀 Image Crawling & Analysis Service (`app.py` & `crawler.py`)

This is the main service, providing a web interface to initiate image crawling jobs.

**🌊 Workflow:**

1.  **📤 Upload:** Users upload a CSV file containing a list of website URLs via a Flask web interface (`app.py`).
2.  **🏷️ Job Creation:** A unique job ID is generated, and a dedicated directory is created for the job's outputs (input CSV, downloaded images, analysis results).
3.  **🏃 Background Processing:** The crawling task (`crawler.py`) is submitted to a thread pool to run in the background, preventing the web interface from freezing.
4.  **🕷️ Crawling (`crawler.py`):**
    *   For each URL from the CSV:
        *   Playwright is used to navigate the website and discover `<img>` tags.
        *   Valid images are downloaded and saved locally to a job-specific, site-specific subfolder.
        *   Duplicate images (based on content hash) are skipped.
5.  **🤖 AI Analysis (`crawler.py` via Ollama):**
    *   For each unique downloaded image:
        *   The image (as base64) is sent to an Ollama server (using a vision model like Llava).
        *   **Description:** A textual description of the image content is generated.
        *   **Categorization:** The image's primary content is classified (e.g., Place, Building, Art).
        *   **Moderation:** The image is checked for sensitive content (Violent, Sexual, etc.) with a confidence score.
6.  **💾 Output:**
    *   All downloaded images are stored in `./jobs/<job_id>/<site_name>/`.
    *   A comprehensive `analysis_results.json` file is saved in `./jobs/<job_id>/`, containing metadata, local paths, and AI analysis for all processed images from that job.

**✨ Features (`app.py`):**

*   **🌐 Web UI:** Simple Flask interface for uploading CSV files with URLs.
*   **📑 Job Management:** Creates unique job IDs and output directories.
*   **⏳ Background Tasks:** Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` for non-blocking crawler execution.
*   **⚡ Flash Messages:** Provides user feedback on uploads and job starts.

**✨ Features (`crawler.py`):**

*   **📄 CSV Input:** Processes multiple URLs from a CSV file.
*   **🕷️ Deep Crawling:** Navigates websites to find images (within the same domain).
*   **🖼️ Image Downloading & Deduplication:** Saves images locally and avoids reprocessing duplicates.
*   **🤖 Ollama Integration:** Connects to an Ollama server for image analysis (description, categorization, moderation).
    *   Supports multiple API paths for Ollama.
    *   Includes retry mechanisms for API calls.
*   **📊 JSON Output:** Saves structured analysis results.
*   **🛡️ Robust Error Handling:** Includes error logging and graceful failure for individual pages/images.

**📋 Prerequisites:**

*   🐍 Python 3.x
*   🖥️ Playwright and its browser drivers (`playwright install --with-deps`)
*   🦙 Ollama installed and running with a vision model (e.g., `llava`).
*   📦 Python libraries: `flask`, `werkzeug`, `playwright`, `Pillow`, `aiohttp`, `requests` (some might be transitively installed by others).
    ```bash
    pip install flask werkzeug Pillow playwright aiohttp requests
    ```

**🔧 Configuration (`app.py` & `crawler.py`):**

*   **Flask (`app.py`):**
    *   `app.config['SECRET_KEY']`: Set for production.
    *   `app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER']`: Temporary storage for uploaded CSVs.
    *   `app.config['JOBS_FOLDER']`: Root directory for all job outputs.

### 2. 🗺️ Sitemap Last Modification Analyzer (`sitemap_processor.py` or `last_update_rss.py`)

A FastAPI application to analyze website sitemaps and extract URL last modification dates. *Two versions are provided: one for single URL processing, another for CSV batch processing.*

**🎯 Purpose:**

*   To discover all pages listed in a website's sitemap(s).
*   To retrieve the `lastmod` (last modification) date for each page, if available.
*   Useful for understanding content freshness or tracking updates.

**✨ Features:**

*   **🔗 Handles Sitemap Index & Regular Sitemaps:** Can process both sitemap index files (linking to other sitemaps) and individual sitemap files.
*   **📅 Extracts `<loc>` and `<lastmod>`:** Parses sitemap XML to get URLs and their last modification dates.
*   **🚀 FastAPI Endpoints:**
    *   `/process_url/`: Accepts a single URL as a query parameter.
    *   `/process_csv/` (in the more advanced version): Accepts a CSV file upload containing URLs.
*   **📝 JSON Output:** Returns results in a structured JSON format (`SitemapResult` model).
*   **🛡️ Error Handling:** Gracefully handles request errors, XML parsing errors, and invalid URLs.

**📋 Prerequisites:**

*   🐍 Python 3.x
*   📦 Python libraries: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `requests`, `pydantic`
    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn requests pydantic
    ```

**🚀 How to Use (Example for CSV version):**

1.  **💾 Save the script:** (e.g., `sitemap_processor.py`).
2.  **▶️ Run FastAPI App:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn sitemap_processor:app --reload
    ```
3.  **🌐 Access API Docs:** Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` in your browser to interact with the API via Swagger UI.
4.  **📤 Use Endpoint:**
    *   Send a `POST` request to `/process_csv/` with a CSV file containing a 'url' column.
    *   Or, send a `GET` request to `/process_url/?url=YOUR_SITEMAP_URL_HERE`.

### 3. 🖼️ Specialized Logo Scraper (`playwright_img_crawler.py`)

A script dedicated to finding and downloading the most likely logo image from a list of websites.

**🎯 Purpose:**

*   To automate the extraction of website logos, which can be tricky due to varied HTML structures.
*   Useful for branding, link previews, or creating a directory of company logos.

**✨ Features:**

*   **📄 CSV Input:** Reads website URLs from a `unique_links_providers.csv` file (hardcoded).
*   **🔎 Smart Logo Detection:**
    *   Uses Playwright to render pages and access dynamic content.
    *   Employs a scoring heuristic based on image `alt` text, `class`/`id` attributes, image dimensions, and location within the HTML (header/nav).
*   **📥 Single Logo Download:** Downloads only the highest-scoring (most likely) logo image per site.
*   **🗂️ Organized Output:** Saves each logo as `logo.<ext>` in a folder named after the website's domain (e.g., `./example.com/logo.png`).

**📋 Prerequisites:**

*   🐍 Python 3.x
*   🖥️ Playwright and its browser drivers (`playwright install --with-deps`)
*   📦 Python libraries: `playwright`, `requests`
    ```bash
    pip install playwright requests
    ```

**🚀 How to Use:**

1.  **💾 Save the script:** (e.g., `playwright_img_crawler.py`).
2.  **📄 Prepare CSV:** Create a file named `unique_links_providers.csv` in the same directory as the script. This CSV must have a header row with a column named `url`. Populate it with website URLs.
3.  **▶️ Execute the script:**
    ```bash
    python playwright_img_crawler.py
    ```
    *   Logos will be downloaded into subfolders created in the current working directory.

## ⚠️ Potentially Redundant Scripts

*   **`img_crawl.py`**: This script appears to be an earlier or simplified version of the image crawling and Ollama analysis logic found in `crawler.py`. It processes a single URL provided via terminal input and doesn't save images locally by default.
*   **`retrieve_img_allsites.py`**: Similar to `img_crawl.py`, this script also performs image crawling and Ollama analysis for a single URL. It *does* save images locally.

**Recommendation:** The functionality of `img_crawl.py` and `retrieve_img_allsites.py` is largely encompassed and improved upon by the `app.py` + `crawler.py` system, which handles batch processing from CSV, job management, and more organized output. Consider if these standalone scripts are still needed or if their specific use cases can be met by the main service. They might be useful for quick, isolated tests.

## 💡 Overall Project Goal (Inferred)

This suite of tools appears to be aimed at building a comprehensive system for:
1.  **Discovering web content:** Through direct crawling and sitemap analysis.
2.  **Extracting visual assets:** Focusing on general images and specific logos.
3.  **Understanding image content:** Using AI (Ollama) to describe, categorize, and moderate images.
4.  **Providing an accessible interface:** A Flask app to manage and initiate image crawling jobs.
5.  **Generating structured data:** Outputting results in JSON and organizing downloaded files.

This could be used for market research, content auditing, building image databases, brand monitoring, or accessibility analysis.
